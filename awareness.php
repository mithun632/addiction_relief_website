  <div class="heading1"><h1>Addiction Awareness</h1></div><br>
  <div class="heading2"><p>Addiction doesn‚Äôt discriminate, and it affects all types of people from different backgrounds. Being aware of the issue allows people from all walks of life to open up.  Many people fall into the delusion that addiction only happens to people who live in certain parts of the country or have specific backgrounds. However, the truth of the matter is that addiction is a disease.  This disease hurts people from all walks of life, some are just better at hiding it. We want anyone struggling with addiction to feel comfortable opening up. Opening up about the issue is the first step in choosing to live a better, sober life.</p></div>

<div class="heading1"><h1>Physical Impact of Drug Addiction</h1></div><br>
  <div class="heading2"><p>Understanding the link between mental health and addiction is important. However, it‚Äôs also essential to understand the physical impact that addiction has on the body. In fact, the physical problems that drugs cause are typically the result of the mental damage that drug abuse causes. 
<br>
    common physical problems include:</div>
    </p><br>
    <div class="list"> <ul>
        <li>Changes in body temperature</li>
         <li>Irregular heartbeat</li>
         <li>Changes in sleep patterns</li>
         <li>Brain damage</li>
         <li>Seizures</ul><br>
            </div>
<div class="heading1"><h1>The Link Between Addiction and Mental Health</h1></div><br>
  <div class="heading2"><p>allows us to educate ourselves on all parts of the issue. Drugs alter the chemical balance in the brain. These changes usually involve increasing the production of dopamine. Two of the top jobs of dopamine include triggering the reward center in the brain and blocking pain. 

    Unfortunately, anytime people alter the chemical balance of their brains, they risk developing mental health disorders.
    
    The brain consists of parts that work together as a team. Each of these parts has its own responsibilities for handling specific functions and performance. Drugs make it difficult for these areas of the brain to communicate with each other properly. 
    
    The parts of the brain that work together include the brain stem, cerebral cortex, and limbic system. The brainstem controls functions such as breathing, sleeping and regulating heart rate. The cerebral cortex controls information regarding the processing of senses such as taste and touch. However, the cerebral cortex also gives the brain its power to think and make decisions.
    
    The limbic system contains the reward circuit of the brain. It controls the ability to feel and regulates pleasure. Since this area of the brain also controls emotions, many drugs specifically target it.
    
    Drug addiction awareness and mental health are two matters that go hand in hand. Addiction often has underlying roots. It can stem from depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and a variety of other different reasons. </p></div>
   
   <div class="heading1"><h1>Why Mental Health is So Important</h1></div><br>
    <div class="heading2"><p>Simply knowing the link between mental health and drugs is only half the battle. It‚Äôs also important to know that mental health and drug addiction awareness are essential in the fight against drug addiction. 

        The importance of spreading drug addiction awareness is why so many rehab centers offer dual diagnosis treatment for co-occurring disorders. This treatment allows rehabs to address both mental health disorders and drug abuse.
        
        Mental health awareness is also important because it lets people know if they‚Äôre more at risk of developing an addiction than others. The World Health Organization says that around 20% of children in the world have a mental health disorder. Scientists believe that these children are more at risk of developing drug addiction than individuals who don‚Äôt have mental health disorders.</p></div>

            <div class="heading2"><p>Every September, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) sponsors Recovery Month to increase national drug addiction awareness. Substance abuse issues must be understood in order to move forward from them.
